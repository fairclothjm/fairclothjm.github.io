            <p>On April 18, 2015 my beautiful fiancee Jessica will finally become my wife. We will be married at her uncle's home in Beaumont, Tx. We began dating January 2010 in Austin, Tx. We have been enganged since Thanksgiving of 2013. All the excitement and stress that comes with planning a wedding has been a great learning experience for both of us. Since I am in school, we haven't planned a honeymoon yet. But we hope to eventually go to Hawaii.
