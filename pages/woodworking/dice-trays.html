                        This was my first dice tray build. I made the sides from salvaged
                        lumber (white oak?) that I got from a cheap bed headboard
                        during my neighborhood bulk trash pickup. The bottom is made
                        from a salvaged piece of 3/8" construction grade plywood. I think it
                        looks alright, despite it's cheap material.

                        My family likes to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle">Farkle</a>
                        and this board has seen a lot of use so far. We play the double scoring variant.

                        These dice trays were all given away as Christmas presents.
                        They were all finished with a few coats of danish oil and then
                        three coats of a water-based polyurethane. The center piece
                        for each of these is made fro 1/4" mahogany.

                        The top tray was built from red oak for the sides. This was a Christmas gift for
                        my wife's aunt Laurie and uncle Rick. They were the ones who taught us farkle!
                        I don't like how the danish oil made the plywood center piece turn yellow.
                        The mahogany veenered side is facing down which is why it doesn't look like
                        mahogany in this picture.

                        The middle tray was built from maple for the sides. It has
                        a really nice wavy grain that you can't see in this picture.
                        This was a gift for my wife's cousin.

                        The last tray was built with oak sides. It has a really nice
                        dark inclusion that makes it very distinct. I built this one
                        with my sister Erin. She wanted to learn woodworking so we
                        spent a Saturday morning putting this together. She gifted
                        this to her boyfriend's son Oliver.
