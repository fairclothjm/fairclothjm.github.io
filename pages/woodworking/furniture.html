                        I don't know if a trash can counts as furniture. But this is my
                        website.

                        This is a design I came up with after looking at similarly designed bins.
                        The bottom is 3/8" plywood. The frame itself is built with salved pine
                        from some Ikea bed slats I picked up on bulk trash day in my neighborhood.

                        I built this mostly to practice my miters with a miter jig
                        that I built based on <a href="https://woodworkingformeremortals.com/make-a-table-saw-miter-sled/">Steve Ramsey's design</a>.
                        I finished it with a few coats of spray on lacquer.
