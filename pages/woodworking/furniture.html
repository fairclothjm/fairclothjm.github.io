          <p><strong>Pine trash can</strong></p>
          <p>
          I don't know if a trash can counts as furniture. But this is my
          website.

          This is a design I came up with after looking at similarly designed bins.
          The bottom is 3/8" plywood. The frame itself is built with salvaged pine
          from some Ikea bed slats I picked up on bulk trash day in my neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p>
          I built this mostly to practice my miters with a miter jig
          that I built based on <a href="https://woodworkingformeremortals.com/make-a-table-saw-miter-sled/">Steve Ramsey's design</a>.
          I finished it with a few coats of spray on lacquer.
